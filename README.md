# 3D Scanner-Based Identification of Welding Defects - Clustering the Results of Point Cloud Alignment

Abstract

This paper describes a~framework for~detecting welding errors using 3D scanner data. The~proposed approach employs density-based clustering to~compare point clouds and identify deviations. The~discovered clusters are then classified according to~standard welding fault classes. 
Six welding deviations defined in~the~ISO 5817:2014 standard were evaluated. All defects were represented through CAD models, and the~method was able to~detect five of~these deviations. The~results demonstrate that the~errors can be effectively identified and grouped according to~the location of~the~different points in~the~error clusters. However, the~method cannot separate crack-related defects as~a~distinct cluster.
